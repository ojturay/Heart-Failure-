Heart Failure Prediction and Survival Analysis

Cardiovascular Diseases kill approximately 17.9 million people globally every year which accounts for 32% of all deaths worldwide (WHO, 2019).
85% were due to heart attack and stroke with over three quarters of Cardiovascular Diseases deaths taking place in low- and middle-income countries.
However, most cardiovascular disease can be prevented by addressing behavioral risk factors to population-wide strategies.
This project is aiming to do an exploratory data analysis,  using generalized linear model to detect the most crucial features to predict the heart failure event and apply Cox model, Survival Analysis, and Hazard Ratio to validate the result.

Dataset contained the medical records of 299 heart failure patients collected at the Faisalaband Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan) in April - December 2015. 
the dataset contains 13 features wwhich report clinical and lifestyle information. some of the features are binary (e.g., diabetic status, anaemeic status, smoking status). information on the serum creatinine levels are available although
dataset does not indicate if any of the patients has a primary kidney disease. The death event feature as our target is a binary classification, states if the patient survived before the end of the follow up period.
